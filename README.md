**Shana is under active development and in a very early stage (in POC phase). Don't use it in any production environment.**

Shana is a next generation cloud native RPC framework. It is designed to be a Go framework plus set of tool chains to make cloud native applications development much easier.

Design goals:

- Cloud native: Shana will be bundled with cloud native infrastructures, such as kubenetes, containerd, etc. It manages the whole microservice ecosystem rather than just a single service.
- Focused: With Shana, developing a microservice will be as simple as writing a function. Developers will be able to focus on business logic and leave the rest to Shana.
- Smart performance optimization: Shana will analyze all Go code and generate optimized code for each microservice. There will be almost no need to tune performance manually, e.g. using `sync.Pool` to reuse objects. Shana will do it for developers automatically. Shana will be able to also use the performance profiles generated by live microservices to optimize the code more intelligently.

To get start with Shana, we can use [the `shana` command line tool](https://github.com/go-shana/cmd/tree/main/shana) to create new project and run it locally.

The document for the package `core` package is not ready now. APIs are not stable at current stage. There are some samples in [Shana samples project](https://github.com/go-shana/samples), which can help us to understand how to use the package `core`.
