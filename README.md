# Shana: Cloud native RPC framework

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/go-shana/core.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-shana/core)

**Shana is under active development and in a very early stage (in POC phase). Don't use it in any production environment.**

Shana is a next generation cloud native RPC framework. It is designed to be a Go framework plus set of tool chains to make cloud native applications development much easier.

Highlights in Shana:

- Cloud native: Shana is bundled with a set of cloud native infrastructures, such as service discovery, service mesh, container runtime, etc. It manages the whole microservice ecosystem rather than just a single service.
- Focused: With Shana, developing a microservice is as simple as writing a function. Developers can focus on business logic and leave the rest to Shana.
- Smart performance optimization: Shana analyzes all Go code and generates optimized code for each microservice. There is almost no need to tune performance manually, e.g. using `sync.Pool` to reuse objects. Shana will do it for you automatically. Shana can also use the performance profiles generated by live microservices to optimize the code more intelligently.

## Getting Started

We can install `shana` command line tool by running:

```bash
go install github.com/go-shana/cmd/shana@latest
```

Then we can create a new microservice project by running:

```bash
shana new your.git.repo/example/my-project
```

This will create a new Go project in `my-project` directory. We can see following files in the directory.

```text
./my-project
 ├── go.mod
 ├── shana.yaml
 ├── welcome.go
```

Enter the directory and run `shana service run` to start the microservice. By default, it starts a HTTP server on port 9696. We can access the service using `curl` command.

```text
$ curl http://localhost:9696/welcome?name=guest
{
  "_debug": {
    "funcName": "Welcome"
  },
  "data": {
    "message": "Hello, guest"
  }
}
```
